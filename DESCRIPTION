Description: nat.amira provides functionality to bridge the visualisation
    capabilities of the NeuroAnatomy Toolbox (nat) package with the Amira 3D
    visualisation software (http://www.fei.com/software/amira-3d-for-life-sciences/).
    The package does not directly require Amira, but of course its
    functionality will be of limited interest to those without access to Amira.

    nat
